# TextMarkupKit

Many iOS applications give you the ability to write plain text in a `UITextView` and format that text based upon simple rules. TextMarkupKit makes it easy to add "format as you type" capabilities to any iOS application. 


It consists of several interrelated components:

1. One set of components let you write a [Parsing Expression Grammar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing_expression_grammar) to define how to parse the user's input. Because writing grammars is hard, TextMarkupKit lets you design "composable grammars." If there is an existing grammar that *almost* provides what you want, you can extend it with additional rules rather than write a new grammar from scratch. TextMarkupKit provides a grammar for a subset of Markdown syntax called *MiniMarkdown*.
2. An implementation of Dubroy & Warth's [Incremental Packrat Parsing](https://ohmlang.github.io/pubs/sle2017/incremental-packrat-parsing.pdf) algorithm to efficiently re-parse text content as the user types in the `UITextView`.
3. A system to format an `NSAttributedString` based upon the parse tree for its `-string` contents. TextMarkupKit's formatting support was designed around the needs of lightweight "human markup languages" like Markdown instead of syntax highlighting of programming languages. In addition to changing the attributes associated with text, TextMarkupKit's formatting rules let you transform the displayed text itself. For example, you may choose to change a space to a tab when formatting a list, or not show the special formatting delimiters in some modes, or replace an image markup sequence with an actual image attachment. TextMarkupKit supports all of these modes.
4. A way to efficiently integrate the formatted `NSAttributedString` with TextKit so it can be used with a `UITextView`.


## Overview of the code

I'm still building out the documentation for TextMarkupKit. In the meantime, this is an overview of the important areas of code.

### Parsing

- `ParsingRule` is an abstract base class. The job of a parsing rule is to evaluate the input text at specific offset and produce a `ParsingResult`, which is a struct that indicates:
    - If the parsing rule succeeded at that location
    - If the rule succeeded, how much of the input string is *consumed* by the rule. Parsing continues after the consumed input.
    - How much of the input string the `ParsingRule` had to look at at to make its success/fail decision.
- `PackratGrammar` is a protocol something that defines a complete grammar through a graph of `ParsingRule`s. `PackratGrammar` exposes a single rule, `start`, that will be used when attempting to parse a string.
- `MemoizationTable` implements the core incremental packrat parsing algorithm. 
    
Additionally, `ParsingRule.swift` defines many simple rules that you can combine to build much more complex rules for constructing your grammar.

- `DotRule` matches any character.
- `Characters` matches any character defined by a `CharacterSet`.
- `Literal` matches a string literal.
- `InOrder` takes an array of child rules and succeeds if **every** one of the child rules succeeds in sequence.
- `Choice` also takes an array of child rules, but matches the **first** of the child rules in the array.
- `AssertionRule` takes a single child rule. It succeeds if its child rule succeeds **but** it does not consume the input.
- `NotAssertionRule`, like `AssertionRule`, takes a single child rule. It will succeed if its child rule fails and vice versa, and never consumes input.
- `RangeRule` takes a single child rule and will try repeatedly match the rule to the input. It succeeds if the number of successful repetitions of the child rule falls within a specified range.

### TextStorage

- `PieceTable` implements the [piece table](https://darrenburns.net/posts/piece-table/) data structure for efficient text editing.
- `PieceTableString` is a subclass of `NSMutableString` that uses a `PieceTable` for its internal storage.
- `ParsedAttributedString` is a subclass of `NSMutableAttributedString` that:
    1. Uses a `PieceTableString` for character storage;
    2. Uses a `MemoizationTable` to parse the string *and* incrementally re-parse the string on each change;
    3. Applies a set of formatting rules based upon the parsed syntax tree to determine the formatting of the string. 
- `ObjectiveCTextStorageWrapper` is an `NSTextStorage` implementation that lets you use a `ParsedAttributedString` as the backing storage for `TextKit`, like `UITextView`.
